# Goal

The **goal** of this report is simply to show off my *R Markdown*
skills. Therefore, it will make no sense at all. Sorry in advance :).

## List

Here is a list, to show you that I can create a list:

-   Are
-   you
-   having
-   fun
-   ?

## Picture

Here is a cute pic of a kitten and a duck, to show you that I can insert
a picture. And also because it’s so freaking cute.
